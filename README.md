### What is this repository for? ###
This project's purpose is to demonstrate - with the least amount of code and scene elements possible - the usage of (Tap)-Gestures in conjunction with Unity's "Holographic Remoting"-feature.
It consists of no more than a single 30-lines-of-code script-file and a cube in an empty scene whose color is changed upon receiving a tap-gesture.
